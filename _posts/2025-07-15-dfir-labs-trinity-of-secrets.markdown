Unzipping the file shows another raw file, so lets search for a profile in volatility

Looks like our image profile will be `Win10x64_19041`

Since its windows 10 its possible volatility 3 will be better but since im already in vol2 ill see if i can grab some things. From cmdlist:
```text
Code.exe pid:   6252
Command line : "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe" 
************************************************************************
Discord.exe pid:   7672
Command line : "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Discord\app-1.0.9147\Discord.exe" 
************************************************************************
OneDrive.exe pid:   7384
Command line : "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneDrive\OneDrive.exe" /background
```

VSCode is a possible place for looking. Possible malware or other files
Discord is another one that we could probably extract some text maybe?
OneDrive could just be used from a start up process but worth verifying

Since VSCode was used quite a bit, there are possibly files that we can uncover so lets use filescan.

There wasnt a lot in there for me to see for now at least. Might come back to it to see if there was anything else.

Another avenue for discovering potential files is malfind. Running that module shows me MsMpEng.exe multiple times so lets do some research to see if this is a normal program. According to google, "MsMpEng.exe is theÂ **Antimalware Service Executable, a core component of Windows Defender**" So if this is getting activated its possible there could be a malicious file somewhere. The rest of the mentions in the malfind output arent too interesting at least to my knowledge. 

The part of the riddle says it lies in your code. But I cant find anything related to VsCode or any files that relate to that. So i think i missed something in filescan so lets go back there and start grepping.

Grepping for "Code" I see git.log which could be helpful.
```text
0x0000cb0f5ef608b0  32761      1 -W-rw- \Device\HarddiskVolume1\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Code\logs\20240522T215144\window1\exthost\vscode.git\Git.log
```
Also possibly interesting is this workspace state file
```text
0x0000cb0f58c54af0  32674      1 RW-rw- \Device\HarddiskVolume1\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\workspaceStorage\1716390920783\state.vscdb
```
So lets dump those and see what we are working with:

For some reason they werent dumping with Vol2 but they do with vol3. After all that work there was nothing really to report from either of these.

With some guidance from the Admins, I was pointed to look for VSCode Backups. Doing some research on where these might be found, I found articles that said the backups or Hot Exits are  usually found in `\Users\<User>\AppData\Roaming\Code\Backups` and sure enough that path was in the `filescan` output. Dumping the virtual address:
```powershell
vol3 -f .\trinity.raw -o .\ dumpfiles --virtaddr 0xcb0f58c6b890
```
Printing the files content to the screen shows:
```text

            char = Mid(message, j, 1)
            encrypted_message = encrypted_message & Chr(Asc(char) Xor Asc(Mid(key, (i - 1) Mod Len(key) + 1, 1)))

```

Looks to be a VBS file. I changed the files name to keep track of it but we may need to use this later on to decrypt a flag.

`The gamers lore`, not sure about that, possibly a discord hint?
`A cached key related to data_3`, I remember some files had some of that appended to the end
The last part seems to hint at discord again.

Lol funny enough when i looked back at my screen from the filescan I saw `Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Code\Cache\Cache_Data\data_3` so lets dump that. Also of note is some discord data that has that so we will dump that as well
```text
0xcb0f58c70520  \Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Code\Cache\Cache_Data\data_3

0xcb0f5f438510  \Users\User\AppData\Roaming\discord\Cache\Cache_Data\data_3
```

Errors on the dumping the files. but i think it got some stuff. the clue says they might be images so im going to try and open them up in gimp to see whats there. Im not really finding anything with GIMP. lots of just garbled images not really images at all to be honest. Maybe Im missing something. I did a blanket search for data_3 and think that There may be some other data I can get from the GPUCache or the DawnCache. Do i know what those do? Nope. But they could be a lead.
```text
0xcb0f58c630a0  \Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Code\GPUCache\data_3
0xcb0f58c63550  \Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Code\GPUCache\data_3

0xcb0f5f42c4e0  \Users\User\AppData\Roaming\discord\GPUCache\data_3

```

Hmmm even less data for the GPUCache and DawnCache. Screw that...

After creating my own forensic machines and getting the updated tools this was a lot easier to process. 

Using binwalk on the data_3 files, i extracted SSL certs from the code source. Maybe that will come about later. The Discord one had a TIFF image and PNG image. The TIFF image I couldnt open possibly corrupted? Or maybe its the one that is encrypted. Not sure but will come back to it.

Extracting the png image yields this image:
![[Pasted image 20250614200956.png]]
I pasted a screengrab of this into google image search and they are semaphore flag signals apparently so I looked into them. Using the schematic here: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Semaphore_Signals_A-Z.jpg we get the message:
`JCNNQ`
Hmmm no signal for the next letter but there is one for the reverse of the signal? maybe ill flip the images?
`PENNYWORTH` 
Ahh yes that seems more likely. From my batman knowledge pennyworth is the last name of Batmans butler Alfred.

So now where? lets look at the clue again:
```text
"""

```
Ok first 2 sentences are just lead in I think, The file with the cached key, so the vscode file had a bunch of keys so I think i got that? the second it says images, plural? so maybe the TIFF file needs to be looked at again.

So yeah lots of binwalking these files. binwalking the PNG shows another tiff file. The tiff is actually supposed to be a WEBP possibly? not sure but looking at the file in XXD I see this encoded string. Its about discord and mentions a url

Looks base encoded with some url encoding as well. Possibly a discord token since it looks like an API request. I tried navigating there but nothing to report. 

So the hint talks about notifications unseen so I think there is some way to find discord messages?

Online i found some reference to cache data again so I'm going to try that:
```text
0xcb0f5f439c80	\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\discord\Cache\Cache_Data\data_0
0xcb0f5f439e10	\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\discord\Cache\Cache_Data\data_1
0xcb0f5f43a130	\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\discord\Cache\Cache_Data\data_2
```
So i found some images in data_2 but they are all just discord asset images. 
data_1 had a gzip compressed file and uncompressing it shows a list of regions and ips:
```text
[{"region":"india","ips":["35.207.240.251","66.22.239.5","35.207.210.191","35.207.211.253","35.207.224.151"]},{"region":"dubai","ips":["66.22.242.8","66.22.242.133","66.22.242.137","66.22.242.6","66.22.242.10"]},{"region":"singapore","ips":["66.22.220.14","35.213.168.191","35.213.165.33","35.213.167.165","35.213.145.149"]},{"region":"hongkong","ips":["35.215.190.51","35.215.161.122","35.215.128.17","35.215.172.57","35.215.149.186"]},{"region":"tel-aviv","ips":["34.0.64.32","34.0.64.225","34.0.64.50","34.0.65.227","34.0.65.31"]}]
```
I doubt this is significant and could possibly be related to some type of CDN type stuff but the locations are pretty suspicious to say the least.

So I was kind of in a stump so I asked for a hint. I knew it had to do with notifications. So i grepped filescan for notifi to see what was there:
```text
vol3 -f trinity.raw windows.filescan | grep notifi

```
It came back with this which i dont know if its helpful but worth a look

Looking for notifications in general, discord and other programs occassionally have notifications storedin the NTUSER.dat registry so diving into that registry i see under SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/Current Version/Notifications/ some interesting keys that could lead to some clues. Nope. Not even. Close. 

After struggling on this for a bit, I reached out to an admin to get some hints on where else I could look. Apparently there is a db called wpndatabase.db that you can dump and analyze so I did windows.filescan and greped for that db and found the virtual address and dumped the file. Now to analyze it. Using SQLITE DB Browser and navigating the Notification table, I found an encrypted string: `Y2lwaGVydGV4dCA9ICI6MD07J1x4MTFoLyhvLlx4MGJoJTJvXHgwM1x4MGI0M1x4MTUvXHgwODQ5XHgwOC4pb1x4MTFoLyhvLjFtMjhceDAzXHgwZW04ODBvXHgxMW9ceDA4NGgoISIK`

So lets use the password PENNYWORTH and the this cipher text and use the vb script to decrypt it. It doesnt really look like an encrypted string. Lets see if its base64 encoded...Yep! It decodes to: 
`ciphertext = ":0=;'\x11h/(o.\x0bh%2o\x03\x0b43\x15/\x0849\x08.)o\x11h/(o.1m28\x03\x0em880o\x11o\x084h(!"`
So our cipher text is actually `:0=;'\x11h/(o.\x0bh%2o\x03\x0b43\x15/\x0849\x08.)o\x11h/(o.1m28\x03\x0em880o\x11o\x084h(!`

The VBS script does not really work as its missing some components so lets convert it to python for some easier decrypting. I used Claude AI to look at the vbs code and generate this script. Basically though, the vbs script does some XOR encryption 10x. So the following is the script that I used to decipher the string:
```python
import hashlib

def decrypt(message, password):
Â  Â  key = hash_password(password)
Â  Â  for i in range(1, 11):
Â  Â  Â  Â  encrypted_message = ""
Â  Â  Â  Â  for j in range(len(message)):
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  char = message[j]
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  key_char = key[(i - 1) % len(key)]
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  decrypted_char = chr(ord(char) ^ ord(key_char))
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  encrypted_message += decrypted_char
Â  Â  Â  Â  message = encrypted_message
Â  Â  return encrypted_message

def hash_password(text):
Â  Â  sha256_hash = hashlib.sha256(text.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
Â  Â  return sha256_hash

if __name__ == "__main__":
Â  Â  password = "PENNYWORTH"
Â  Â  ciphertext = ":0=;'\x11h/(o.\x0bh%2o\x03\x0b43\x15/\x0849\x08.)o\x11h/(o.1m28\x03\x0em880o\x11o\x084h(!"
Â  Â  decrypted = decrypt(ciphertext, password)
Â  Â  print(f"Decrypted: {decrypted}")
```

Running the script we get:
Decrypted: `flag{M4st3rW4yn3_WhoIsTheTru3M4st3rm1nd_R1ddl3M3Th4t}`
